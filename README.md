# Dotfiles for WezTerm and StarShip

This repository contains my configuration files for my dot files.
I would advice against blindly installing these dotfiles.

## run the script to create symlinks

1. **Make the Script Executable**:
   ```sh
   chmod +x ~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   ```sh
   ~/.dotfiles/bootstrap.sh
   ```
