# TODO

## Wezterm

- better keymaps (windows & tabs)
- tab bar:
  - remove elements by size of window

## NeoVim

- lsp: spelling
- explore mini.nvim vs stacks
- Replace NeoTree with Oil
- floating windows: command, search, etc
- line swapping and blank line keymaps

## Mac

- custom Karabiner-Elements for wezterm
  - this will allow copy pasting with remapped keys & still interacting with Neovim and wezterm in the way I expect
